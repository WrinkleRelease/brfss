# About

`sec-vars-type.csv`:
- used to generate a 'cut list', to automate chopping my large CSV dataset into smaller ones comprised of one section each
- used to generate a `CREATE TABLES` series of statements which I plugged into dBeaver to create all the tables at once
- used to generate a a series of psql `\copy` statements to take the data from the individual csv files and plug them into their relative SQL tables
